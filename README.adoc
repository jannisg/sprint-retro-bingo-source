= Sprint Retro Bingo

This is a sample application for Flutter that allows people to start
coding with streams and have a basic application where understanding
where the model data comes from is easy and simple.

=== PRs

If you have sample lines from your own Sprints you want to include,
as long as they are not offensive to me (i.e. not racist, sexist or -phobic),
please send them along!

=== Structure

`files.txt` contains the list of possible tabs. All files are UNIX
style separated, please no Windows line endings.
